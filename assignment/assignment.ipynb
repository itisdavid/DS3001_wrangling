        "\n",
        "  1. Read the abstract. What is this paper about?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Wickham is interested in the process of data cleaning at a deeper level. For example, when exactly do we know when we're done with data cleaning? When there are no NULLs? Wickham observes rows as observations/instances, columns as attributes/variables, and tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Tidy data standard is intended to help standardize data cleaning and make it an easier process.\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, itâ€™s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "  \"LIke families...\" means dysfunctional and disorganized data present unique, new problems while clean data all present similar properties since they've all undergone a specific process for a specific outcome. \"For a given...\" means that it is easier for data scientists to \"assign\" variables and observations to the values in the data, however, it might not be as easy as it seems for people who haven't done it before or aren't familiar with the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "  4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Values make up a dataset and are numeric or categorical. Values belong to both a variable and an observation. Variables are a collection of values that measure the same attribute. Observations are a collection of values.\n",
        "\n",
        "  5. How is \"Tidy Data\" defined in section 2.3?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Tidy data is defined by a dataset where each column is a variable, each row is an observation, and a table is a type of obervational unit.\n",
        "\n",
        "  6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? Why are the data in Table 4 messy? What is \"melting\" a dataset?\n",
        "\n",
        "  The five most common problems with messy data are column header naming can be values and not variable names, storing multiple variables in one column, storing variables in rows and columns, storing multiple types of observational units in the same table, storing a single observational unit in multiple tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "  The data in Table 4 is messy because the column headers looks like values for what seems to be income.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Melting a dataset is the process of converting column-value variables into rows.\n",
        "\n",
        "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Table 11 is messy because it has day numbers, which are values, as headers. Table 12b is tidy and molten because it turns the days in table 11's header into a single column called date and converts the tmax and tmin measurements into columns. All entries are attributes and not variable names.\n",
        "\n",
        "  8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  The chicken-and-egg problem is if tidy data is only as useful as the tools that work with it, then tidy tools will be inextricably linked to tidy data. Wickham hopes that the concept of tidy data isn't just to learn how to use ggplot2 but to create an ecosystem of ideas and tools for data science."
